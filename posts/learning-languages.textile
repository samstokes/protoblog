h1. Why learn languages?

* Say something about pragprog and Giles Bowkett

* Say something about natural languages

Recently I've been learning Haskell and Scala.

I'd been meaning to look at Haskell for a while, but been put off by the impression that you needed to be an expert in abstract algebra to even begin learning it.  One day I just tried it (*TODO* mention RWH, LYAH), and found it's actually pretty easy to get into, if you're willing to accept a little bit of magic (i.e. defer full understanding) with respect to how it handles I/O.  It's *very* expressive, in ways that are mind-expanding, and its type inference actually helps you write programs rather than just providing (arguable) safety guarantees.

* Notes about pragmatism (compiles to native code, can call into C)
* Examples of expressiveness (e.g. composition, {{{lift}}}) and abstraction

* Scala blah
